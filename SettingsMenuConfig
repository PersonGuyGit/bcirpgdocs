## Quick start

This module is the behind the scenes code for the Settings Menu UI. Here is what this file does for the project.

- Provides an easy to use interface to change player settings
- Provides a human readable .cfg file for players to edit or view (Similar to a .ini file)

## What's included

In this file the main functions that are of importance are saveToFile and saveToInstance. 

- **saveToFile** allows for you to create the actual cfg file. Be sure to follow this template for adding a new item to the cfg. <br> The general process of storing a value, is to import the UI option from  .tscn, then just create another set_value function as shown below.
  > **Template:** iniFile.set_value(rowName, varName, Var.selection)
  
  > **Example Usage:**  iniFile.set_value("player_preferences", "player_name", NameVar.text)

- **saveToInstance** allows for you to save the same value that you put into the .cfg file, into a Singleton file. <br> This reduces the need to directly read from the save file for every single check needed. 

  > **Template:** ImportedsaveObject.InstanceObject.valueYouWantToSaveFromInstance = NameVar.text
  
  > **Example Usage:** saveObject.settingsInstance.inputName = NameVar.text


```
